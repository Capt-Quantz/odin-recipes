    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Tinola</strong> is a traditional Filipino comfort food that usually consists of broth, chicken, 
            leafy greens, papaya, and ginger. Fish sauce is a key ingredient that lends a deliciously 
            pungent taste. Chicken tinola is often served with rice to make a hearty meal.
